# BitsyMiner Open Source

BitsyMiner is a Bitcoin lottery miner application designed to run on ESP32 microcontroller devices.

### Required Hardware

BitsyMiner was first programmed to run specifically on "Cheap Yellow Display" boards with 2.8" ILI9341 displays. I have since gotten it working on ST7789 displays, as well as the 2.4" ILI9341 boards, which have a slightly different pin configuration.

You can also compile and run the code in headless mode (no display), which should work on boards that fall under the ESP32 Dev Module category.

The current code includes inline assembly that is very hardware-dependent and is not compatible with other board types.

There is also a separate native Linux headless miner in `odroid/` for ARM SBC experiments, including ODROID-MC1 Solo / XU4-class boards and Orange Pi PC / Allwinner H3 boards.

### Installation

**Option 1:** Compile from Source with PlatformIO

Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) using either the VS Code extension or PlatformIO Core.

The included `platformio.ini` is configured for the LCDWiki / Cheap Yellow Display 2.8" ESP32-32E board with an ILI9341 display and XPT2046 touch controller. The default environment is `cyd`, and PlatformIO will install the Arduino framework and project libraries automatically on the first build.

From the project root, build the firmware:

```sh
pio run
```

Connect the ESP32 board over USB, then upload:

```sh
pio run -t upload
```

To specify a serial port explicitly, list connected devices and pass the upload port:

```sh
pio device list
pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/tty.usbserial-0001
```

Open the serial monitor at the configured `115200` baud rate:

```sh
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

The PlatformIO configuration already sets the required Arduino core placement and partition scheme:

- `ARDUINO_RUNNING_CORE=0`
- `ARDUINO_EVENT_RUNNING_CORE=0`
- `board_build.partitions = min_spiffs.csv`

To build for a different supported hardware target, update the `build_flags` in `platformio.ini`. For example, the current `cyd` environment defines `ESP32_2432S028` and `LCDWIKI_ESP32_32E_28`. Headless builds should use `ESP32_DEV_HEADLESS`, and ST7789 display builds should define `ST7789_LCD` with matching TFT_eSPI driver and pin settings.


**Option 2:** Compile from Source with the Arduino IDE

Set up your environment by installing all of the required libraries in the Arduino IDE, attach your device, compile, and install.

Changes to display type can be set in `defines_n_types.h`.

In the tools menu, change the settings as follow:

- Arduino Runs on Core 0
- Events Run on Core 0
- Partition Scheme: Minimal SPIFFS (1.9MB APP with OTA/190KB SPIFFS)


**Option 3:** Install from Binaries

You can now find the binaries in the individual releases. You will see two types of binaries, one for doing a new install, and one for upgrading a device. The first will overwrite the entire device, and the latter can be used for just overwriting the application area so you don't lose your data.

Use the [ESP Tool](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) to connect to and program the device.

For a new installation, set the flash address to 0x0 and write the "New Install" binary.

For upgrading an existing BitsyMiner installation, set the flash address to 0x10000 and write the "Upgrade" binary.

After installing, you can follow the setup video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur3amBXdaBI).

### Programming Environment

BitsyMiner started as a personal project to learn more about Bitcoin mining. For simplicity's sake, I began working in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). This repository now also includes a PlatformIO configuration for repeatable command-line and VS Code builds.


<br/><br/>
### Required Libraries

When using PlatformIO, these libraries are declared in `platformio.ini` under `lib_deps` and are installed automatically. Arduino IDE users should install them manually.
